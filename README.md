# Changes
- Title: renamed the page title.
- CSS reorganization: re-ordered the CSS selectors to follow the HTML structure more closely.
- Header/Footer: Changed the "header" and "footer" div classes to the header and footer semantic HTML elements.
- Cover image: Changed the "hero" div class to "cover-img" img class to better represent its purpose, and linked it directly in the HTML. This also required correcting the link to the file path.
- Navigation links: Changed the div tags to nav tags for the navigation links, and fixed the broken nav link.
- Redundant classes: removed classes with common attribute values and refactored the HTML accordingly.

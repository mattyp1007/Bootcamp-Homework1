# Semantic HTML Elements
- Changed the "header" and "footer" div classes to the header and footer semantic elements.
- Changed the "hero" div class to "cover-img" img class to better represent its purpose, and corrected  the file path accordingly.
- Changed the div tags to nav tags, since they were only used for the navigation links.
- Removed redundant classes within the "benefits" and "sections" class
